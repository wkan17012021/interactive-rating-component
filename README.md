## Overview

It's been a while since I worked on these challenges due to work commitments. It was nice to practice my coding skills from recent work where I haven't been doing that much actual coding. But, it was not nice to see how rusty I have gotten xD

This is the first (or early) challenges requiring JS to present the active states. It certainly was good practice as I have been learning React lately, so there is some vanilla JS I have forgotten. This challenge served to refresh the pure JS skills.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

Start with the mobile design, add the styling incrementally and iterate as necessary for state changes. Then set variables for dom elements, target with functions and hookup with event listeners. Work back to the desktop design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (for design colors)
- Tailwind CDN ðŸ’¨
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Slowly getting better with Tailwind classes. I used a TW UI comp from their library for the initial markup. This was accessible to me via a work account.
- Event listeners syntax and DOM manipulation.
-

### Continued development

Still rusty with JS fundamentals like writing the syntax for event listeners and manipulating styling. This translated to non-productive time. There are a few non-conformance styling that needs improvement as well.

Time:
18/04/2022 20:40 - 23:15 (review design, choose TW comp, setup /config / source control for proj, iterating through TW classes for mobile design, amending markup, getting event listeners working and testing.)
